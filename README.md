As there is a complex version correspondence between Scala, Hadoop and Spark, it is recommended to use the same environment as the project, otherwise it may fail to build the project correctly.

Scala 2.11.12
Java8 corretto-1.8 is used in project (openjdk version "1.8.0_362")
Hadoop 2.7.1
Spark version 2.3.2
